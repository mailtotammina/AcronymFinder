# Acronym Finder Sample Application

DictTest is a sample project to show the abbreviations of the acronyms entered by user 

This project is developed in Objective C language, using the ide XCODE 6.4

I've used Cocopods as library dependancy manager.
I've included the following libraries as part of project

I've used "http://www.nactem.ac.uk/" rest api to make calls and to figure out acronyms.
